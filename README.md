Since 2004 [[1]](#1) layered crystals (called two-dimensional or van der Waals materials) have been one of the most active areas of research in materials science. The best method to prepare two-dimensional materials is mechanical exfolitation: a non-deterministic procedure where we press a thick crystal onto a silicon wafer, leaving behind crystal fragments which are occasionally only a few atoms thick. For example, to prepare graphene (a monolayer of carbon atoms) we press graphite crystals onto a silicon wafer. We use a microscope to search the debris for thin crystals, which are typically about 4-10% darker than the bare wafer. The procedure is summarized below:
