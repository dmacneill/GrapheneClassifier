Since 2004 [[1]](#1) layered crystals (called two-dimensional or van der Waals materials) have been one of the most active areas of research in materials science. The most common method to prepare two-dimensional materials is mechanical exfolitation: a non-deterministic procedure where we press a thick crystal onto a silicon wafer, leaving behind crystal fragments which are occasionally only a few atoms thick. For example, to prepare graphene (a monolayer of carbon atoms) we press graphite crystals onto a silicon wafer. We use a microscope to search the debris for thin crystals, which are typically about 4-10% darker than the bare wafer. Some images of crystallites prepared by mechanical exfoliation are shown below:

Depending on the material this search (colloquially termed "flake-hunting") can be quite time-consuimg, even taking several hours. Many research groups have tried to automate the process, but so far no solution has been convenient or reliable enough for widespread adoption. The group I work in at MIT has also put efforts into automated flake-hunting [[2]](#2), and this project is a continuation of that.
